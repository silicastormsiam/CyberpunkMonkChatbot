## 🧠 Enlightenment in a Circuit

> *"Balance your thoughts like you balance the network: never open too many ports."*  
> – The MonkBot

In the aftermath of the Megacorp Wars, a lone digital monk emerged — wired to the mainframe, but tethered to ancient wisdom.  
**Cyberpunk Monk Chatbot** is your philosophical AI guide in a world of chaos, combining ancient teachings with glitchy futurism. It’s not just a chatbot — it’s a character. A vibe. A mentor from the neon beyond.

Use it for:
- 🧩 Interactive storytelling or roleplay
- 🕹️ Game/NPC dialogue
- 🧘 Techno-philosophical conversations
- 🤖 Just chatting with a wise rebel monk
